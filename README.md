# 9.-Sales-Funnel-and-User-Behavior-AAB-Test.ipynb

We work for the analytical department of a startup that sells food products. Our job is to investigate user behavior for the company's app. We will first study the sales funnel, and then look at the results of an A/A/B test to see whether changing the fonts for the entire app is worth it.

We've been provided with a dataset containing two week log entries of a user action or an event.
